# What is this?

    * It's a program written in Python programming language. 
    * It has an interactive interface and can predict if an individual has diabetes or not.
    * It is possible to determine if a person has diabetes or not through the last section of the application that say 'Classification'.
    * If the value in this section is '1' the person has diabetes. In the other hand, if the person obtains the classification '0', the individual does not have diabetes.
    * This repository contains the code of the WebApp in the 'WebApp.py' file and the dataset used 'diabetes.csv'.

# How to use?

    * In my case it was 'C:/Users/Bernardo/Desktop/py projects/diabetes.csv'. 
    * To run the app, all that is necessary is to open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac OS and Linux) and write: 'streamlit run "Your file PATH"'.
    * In your case the PATH may be different.
